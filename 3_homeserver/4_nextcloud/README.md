### what does this server does:
* Creates a nextcloud server , also is using swag reverse proxy.
* Added this to homeserver mainly for streaming purpose as jellyfin didn't have support for vlc and also it was not performing so good on my android device, storage and other features of nextcloud is important byproduct.
